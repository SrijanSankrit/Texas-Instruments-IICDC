Texas Instruments IICDC 2018 - Team 39003 Submissions (Business and Technical)

## Project Description
Motor Vehicle Collisions are responsible for the death of 150,000 citizens annually in India. While a number of factors such as subpar infrastructure, poor visibility etc. come into play, in the majority of cases, humans are to blame. Reckless driving presents itself in many forms, such as drunk driving, driving while texting, not paying attention to the road, driving while sleepy/tired etc. and can result in a huge loss to life and limb.

Our project aims at helping prevent motor vehicle collisions through the continuous monitoring of (both) external and internal surroundings of the vehicle. Externally, we aim to monitor the vehicle's location with respect to other vehicles, providing guidance for minimum safety distances for braking, situational awareness in poor visibility conditions and alerting the driver of traffic in the blind spots. Internally, we will monitor the attentiveness and alertness of the driver through computer vision, ensuring that he/she is fit to drive.
